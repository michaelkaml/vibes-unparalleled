DISCO:
All of the traversals we learned have the same three steps, but arranged in a different order.
They all have: process node, recurse left, recurse right.

QCC:
Is there a simpler way to express the code for insertion?
What are the uses of binary search trees, and what is it best used for?
Are there any traversals that don't use those 3 steps?

L = level, d = depth, h = height
1) A perfect binary tree has 2^L-1 nodes.
2) At each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes.
3) Height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is sqrt(n) rounded up to nearest whole number.
