DISCO:
The add method is a pass-through method, since it uses the add method of AL.
A priority queue can't be described cleanly with a short description like FIFO or LIFO, etc.

QCC:
How would we do remove min for Objects in general?
We think it would only work for Comparables, since we would have to use the compareTo() method.

Why did we return ints, not Integers?

The API was useful for telling us what exception to throw if the queue was empty. (runtime exception)

The difference between a human implementation of a priority queue and a computer implementation of a priority queue is that a human would have to keep everything in order based on priority as new elements are added and removed.
A computer doesn't need to do that, since it doesn't necessarily need to keep things in order, since it can traverse and look for the next element.
