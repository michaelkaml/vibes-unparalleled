HW90 - Deque
2022-04-11m
time spent:  hr

DISCO:
While looking through the Java API for Deque, we noticed that many of the methods included in Dequeue were very similar to the ones in LinkedList.
After further investigation, we found that LinkedList implements List and Deque, and therefore inherits some methods from both interfaces.

QCC:
We decided to use LinkedList because it seems like it would be easier to implement.
Before coding, we thought that Deque looked a lot like a doubly LinkedList.
(later confirmed by looking at Java API)

We felt that our implementation of this using LL was too easy because everything Deques do, LLs do.
