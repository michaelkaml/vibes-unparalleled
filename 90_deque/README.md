HW90 - Deque
2022-04-11m
time spent:  hr

Steps:
1) Make interface
2) Achieve compileability (gradually)
3) enqueue (addfirst, addlast)
4) dequeue (removefirst, removelast)
5) peek (peekfirst, peeklast)
6) offer and poll can use add and remove

After reading the API a little more, we decided that we would not implement offer, since there is no capacity built into our implementation of Deque.
