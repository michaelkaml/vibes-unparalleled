HW60:A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle 

DISCO:

* All thinkeren were moving in random patterns, making the sorting mechanism inefficient and inaccurate.
* Sometimes, thinkeren were given too many or too few cards.
* For example, I was given three cards, which left me wondering how to give them to the other thinkeren.

QCC: 

* Can we program simulations in java as we can in netlogo?
* Why do termites in netlogo follow random patterns?

THINKER FIRMWARE:

If cards in hand, find turtle with hand raised, then give card to turtle. Once all cards are given, go to starting point, and position hands upward.
If cards not in hand at start of operation, raise hand and wait for a turtle to give you cards. Once cards in hand, follow line 19.
