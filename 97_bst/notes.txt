HW97 -- Prune Your Tree

DISCO:
It could be helpful to save the cargo of the next greatest node instead of the node itself, so that children don't need to be disconnected.
It's helpful to have a follower and searcher pointer, but we had to be careful when we want to remove the root, since follower is null.

QCC:
Is there a better way to search for the next greatest node without using two temp variables?
How would we have done this recursively? (and is there a difference in complexity?)

Removing nodes with 2 children results in a lot more complexity than cases with 1 child or no children.
This is because nodes with no children can be easily removed by pointing to null.
Removal of nodes with 1 child is like removal in a linkedlist, which is just pointing the parent to the next node.
However, removing nodes with 2 children results in having to traverse the tree to find the next greatest node, then replacing the removed one with that node, which adds complexity.
Also, the next greatest node might have left children.
