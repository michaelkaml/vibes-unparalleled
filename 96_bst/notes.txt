HW96 -- BSTs is the Perfect Place for Shade
2022-05-10t
time spent: 0.8 hrs

DISCO:
We believe that the runtime of our search algorithm is O(logn).
This is because when we search for a value, we disregard roughly half (or at least the rest) of the tree.
Each step recursively does this, so we think this results in a logn runtime.

QCC:
What is the runtime of this search algorithm? (possibly answered in DISCO)
What is the use of numLeaves()?
Can BSTs only store integers (or numbers in general)? If not, how would a BST work?

(maybe getting ahead of ourselves)
How would we remove nodes?
