Lab09: Some Folks Call It A Charades

time spent:

Activity 1:
1) A celebrity class, game class, (hat class)
2) points, array(list) of celebrities
3) play game, update score, choose next celebrity, add/remove celebrity, checking if clue valid, check guess correctness
4) we think all of these can be put into methods because they all work with the instance variables we plan to have
5) play method should have a way to add celebrity names at the beginning
start game
start timer
in loop until timer stops?
  choose next celebrity
  reader: give clue
  guesser: take input for guesses
  check correctness
    if correct, discard celebrity
    update score
return score
end game
6) using a combination lock as an example for a real-world object, the information it has could be the correct code as well as user input
behaviors could be checking if numbers are correct, and unlocking/locking
7) skip?

Activity 2:
1) to create new instance of that object, initialize instance vars
2) public ClassName(optional parameters) {}
3) String name
depending on if game is multiplayer, String clue might exist
(upon looking at code, we noticed that clue is built in, and the clue is inputted in constructor)
4) accessor methods for name and clue
constructor with name and clue as parameters
5) completed class
6) made test cases
7) we only have a single constructor, but an additional constructor could be
public Celebrity() {}
which just declares the variables name and clue to a default value instead of user inputted values

Activity 3:
1) we chose the JComponent class
if cursor is paused over a component, a string is displayed in a small window near the component
when a key is pressed, the component will react
the setBorder method can change the look of the component
the setLookAndFeel method under UIManager can change the look and feel
2) private ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
3) the visibility of gameCelebrity should match that of celebGameList, as instance variables should be private (preferred)
4) in file
5) in file
6)
