Python was the simplest, requiring just a "print("Hello, World!")". Racket needed me to specify the specific language I was using beforehand, and didn't require the parentheses like Python did. Netlogo was the most complex. I had to write a command (to greet) so that I could save it as a file. Opening the file and typing "greet" as observer will yield "Hello, World!". Overall, these were pretty similar. Python was the only one that required parentheses in addition to quotation marks around the string, but I feel like that makes things clearer
